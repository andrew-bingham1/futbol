## Retrospective 
![Retro](retro.png)

[Sailboat Method](https://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/projects/leadership-team-management/how-run-sprint-retrospective/#sailboat-method) 
- This is where we discovered this method for running a retrospective

### Top things that went well during your project 
- We had excellent communication 
- We targeted our learning goals and gave each other opportunities to practice them 
- Everyoneâ€™s great work ethic
### Top things your team would do differently next time
- We should have planned everything more at the start (naming conventions, etc)
- Should have avoided working late into the night on some pieces
